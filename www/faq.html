    <strong>Is  the information a Volunteer shares with the Victim Advocate confidential?</strong><br />
    The Victim Advocate only shares  information that is necessary to facilitate access to the services requested by  a Volunteer.  The Victim Advocate will  inform the Volunteer of who is being told, what they are being told, and why so  that the Volunteer may make an informed decision regarding the information  being shared.  [Except in an emergency,  the Victim Advocate will ask for the Volunteer consent before sharing information  with anyone else.]<br />
    <strong>Can  a Volunteer make an anonymous report to the Victim Advocate?</strong><br />
    A Volunteer can make an anonymous report  to the Victim Advocate, but this will limit the services that the Victim  Advocate will be able to provide.<br />
    <strong>Can  a Volunteer choose which services the Victim Advocate will provide?</strong><br />
    Volunteers are not required to use any  of the services available from the Office of Victim Advocacy.  It is entirely up to the Volunteer to decide  which of those services to use.
